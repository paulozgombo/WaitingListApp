Main Goal - [This project aims to help address a problem that has been a pain for me as an Angolan citizen.]

I am creating an app with React. The goal is to develop an application that helps manage a waiting list for attention in public or private institutions, as many African countries face issues related to this. I do not want to use a database to store data; instead, I want a simulated database. This project is completely frontend-only.

My idea is to have one screen where users can specify their issue. Automatically, they should receive an ID and a reference pass that indicates their position in the waiting list, as well as how many people are ahead of and behind them. There will also be a button for users to deny their entry and remove themselves from the list.

An admin section is necessary to view the number of people on the waiting list and to indicate whether a person has been attended to. Additionally, the admin section will display statistics, such as how many people have denied their entry and how many have been attended to.
