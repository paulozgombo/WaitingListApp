This project explores frontend data persistence by using browser-based caching mechanisms as the primary storage layer. Instead of relying on a backend database, all application data is stored and managed through runtime state and browser storage (LocalStorage / IndexedDB).

The goal is to understand data lifecycle, cache invalidation strategies, state synchronization, and persistence architecture entirely on the client side.
